# agenda-generator
Cool everyday agenda generator for shell script nerd secretaries (primarily for PENABURians?).

*Context: my school has a system where somebody could be a secretary in a class and they're gonna do the kind of job that requires writing/typing*

🌟 Interactive and intuitive prompts
🌟 Greater readability with emoticons
🌟 Modular (to some extent)
🌟 Persistent storage support


(I really want to make an Android/iOS version for this app for future secretaries 😁)

# Warning
- Many hardcoded paths, names, and data (this is for my personal use)—can still be changed by editing the script directly. Data examples can be find under [data/](data/)
- I don't care about the cleanliness of this script. If it works, it works.
